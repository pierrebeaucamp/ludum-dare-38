# Ludum Dare 38
This is a placeholder repository for Ludum Dare 38. Since it's still a while
until the jam is happening, I'm taking the opportunity to prepare some engine
code, so the LD weekend itself can be spend on actually designing a game.

### Local Development
To run a local version of this app, make sure to have both
[Idris](http://www.idris-lang.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)
instealled. Then, simply run `make server` from inside this repository. This
will compile the code and run a webserver on port [8000](http://localhost:8080)
